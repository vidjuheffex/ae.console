        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Console is a simple GUI script for After Effects that creates a console in which you can type Extendscript commands to be executed.</p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Command History - Press ⇧ to re-access previous commands.</li>
            <li>Error Reporting - Echo's back errors into the console as well as changing the status bar of the console red.</li>
            <li>Quick Objects - <span class="code">project</span>, <span class="code">items</span>, <span class="code">renderQueue</span>, and <span class="code">selection</span> have been added as built-in objects to reduce typing.</li>
            <li>Floating or Docking Interface - Adding the script to your ScriptsUI folder, adds it to After Effects 'window' menu and allows it dock. Running the script through a launcher or from "File > Scripts > Run Script File..." launches a non-dockable version.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Issues and Limitations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="code">project.activeItem</span> can't be referenced since the GUI panel becomes the active item.</li>
            <li>variables declared with <span class="code">var</span> will not exist outside their current command. For example, after running <span class="code">var dog = "sparky"</span>, subsequent commands will not have access to <span class="code">dog</span>, whereas with <span class="code">dog = "sparky"</span>, <span class="code">dog</span> will be available in the global namespace. </li>
            <li>Quick Objects - <span class="code">project</span>, <span class="code">items</span>, <span class="code">renderQueue</span>, and <span class="code">selection</span> have been added as built-in objects to reduce typing.</li>
        </ul>
